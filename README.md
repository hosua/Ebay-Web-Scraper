# Ebay Web Scraper
 A simple web scraper made using Selenium

## External Modules used

selenium, colorama

The code uses Chrome and will require Chrome webdrivers in order for the program to work. You can edit the code to work with Opera, IE, or Firefox yourself if you wish.

Run main.py to run the program. I also suggest putting it in into its own directory. It will make JSON files and save them in its current directory.
