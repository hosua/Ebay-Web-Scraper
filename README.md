# Ebay Web Scraper
A simple web scraper made in Python using Selenium

## External Modules used

selenium, colorama

Before running the program, you will need these modules. You can get them by typing in  ``` pip install selenium ``` and ``` pip install colorama ``` into your command prompt/terminal.

## Notes

The code uses Chrome and will require the [Chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) in order for the program to work, you can follow [this guide](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started). You can edit the code to work with Opera, IE, or Firefox yourself if you wish (you will have to also set up their respective web driver as well).

I suggest putting all these files in into their own folder. It will make JSON files and save them in its current directory. To run the program, run main.py.
