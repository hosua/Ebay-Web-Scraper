# Ebay Web Scraper
A simple web scraper made in Python using Selenium

## External Modules used

selenium, colorama

## Notes

The code uses Chrome and will require the [Chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) in order for the program to work. You can edit the code to work with Opera, IE, or Firefox yourself if you wish (you will have to also set up their respective web driver as well).

I suggest putting all these files in into their own folder. It will make JSON files and save them in its current directory. To tun the program, run main.py.
